[中文版指南](./README.md)

To date, there is a lack of open source books available for Chinese natural language processing. The purpose of launching this repository is to collect open copyright Chinese books for use by scholars and industrial production.

## Usage

All books are under the `books` directory, and the book index is shown in `index.csv`.

## Contributing

Welcome your contribution!

### Add new book

Before adding a book, it is strongly recommended that you use the regular expressions in the `ill_ocr_patterns.txt` list to search for possible OCR errors in the book and correct them.

It is hoped that all content of the books you contribute is open copyright.

## At Last

Good luck to all natural language developers!
